# Emotion-Detection-Using-MobileNetV2
A deep learning-based image classification model that detects human emotions (like happy, sad, angry, etc.) from facial images. Leveraged transfer learning using MobileNetV2 and trained it on a labeled emotion dataset with TensorFlow and Keras. The model achieved reliable accuracy and supports real-time inference for emotion classification.
